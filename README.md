# ComputerVisionProjects
This repository contains tutorial projects from WorldQuantUniversity for the Applied AI for Computer Vision Laboratory

## List of projects
- Project 1 is about Wildlife Conservation in Côte d'Ivoire. You’ll assess a data science competition designed to help scientists track animals in a wildlife preserve.
- Project 2 takes you to Uganda, where you’ll build a neural network to classify images of crop disease.
- From there, we travel to Bangladesh for Project 3 to create an object detection model to monitor traffic in Dhaka.
- In Project 4, we’ll perform face detection and recognition tasks using a video interview of Indian Olympic boxer Mary Kom.
- Project 5 takes us to Spain, where we’ll use neural networks to generate a variety of medical images.
- For Project 6, we’ll explore social media marketing in the United States.
