# ComputerVisionProjects
This repository contains tutorial projects from WorldQuantUniversity for the Applied AI for Computer Vision Laboratory

## List of projects
- Project 1 is about Wildlife Conservation in Côte d'Ivoire. You’ll assess a data science competition designed to help scientists track animals in a wildlife preserve.
- Project 2 takes you to Uganda, where you’ll build a neural network to classify images of crop disease.
- From there, we travel to Bangladesh for Project 3 to create an object detection model to monitor traffic in Dhaka.
- In Project 4, we’ll perform face detection and recognition tasks using a video interview of Indian Olympic boxer Mary Kom.
- Project 5 takes us to Spain, where we’ll use neural networks to generate a variety of medical images.
- For Project 6, we’ll explore social media marketing in the United States.

## Datasets
- DrivenData.org's images captured by camera traps in wildlife for conservation purposes. Each image is a jpeg file, with metadata (id, filepath, site of image.)
  Every image is either blank or contains the following animals (1. Antelope 2. Bird 3. Civet_genet 4. Hog 5. Leopard 6. Monkey_prosimian 7. Rodent)
  The data is labelled in a csv file in a one-hot encoded way.

## Evaluation Methodology
- Project1: Logloss performance metric between truth labels and predicted labels

## Libraries Used
- Project1: matplotlib, pandas, torchvision, pytorch
